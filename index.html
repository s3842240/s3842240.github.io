<p style="font-family:arial;" style="text-align:center;"> <b>Summary:</b> 
I’m Aussie and I’ve never been overseas. I studied at Taylor’s Lakes Secondary College and graduated with an ATAR of 73.something. 
I studied math, English, two IT subjects and I was present in physics most of the time. I speak fluent English and I learnt a bit of Japanese 
in school but I didn’t like getting graded on it so I dropped it. I have two pet dogs and I had a pet cat but unfortunately he passed away recently. 
My brother has a snake and two cats. I’m going to be an uncle in a couple of weeks. I’ve liked video games ever since played Halo:CE on the original 
Xbox. I’ve also been learning programming to code and create games in my spare time alongside learning about computer hardware and seeing how it 
evolves and continues to improve with each cycle. I play tennis competitively, well not right now, but before the pandemic I played in Juniors at 
A Reserve 5, which was near the top grade. I also played in Seniors at C Reserve 2 and I played Pennant at Grade 10.</p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;"> What is my Interest in IT? </h1>

<pre> My interest in IT is primarily in programming and creating software and games, but I also have a bit of a side interest 
in computer hardware. I had my old build custom built and I chose the parts but I was hesitant to build it myself the first 
time around because $3000 was a lot to me in year 8, but whenever I got the chance I took apart old laptops and desktops to 
have a look inside and see the parts for myself. The older machines were all similar but now that my income is a bit more 
solid and I have more disposable income than I did at year 8 I can afford to build a modern desktop myself. My interest in IT 
started when I was 6 years old and my brother let me play the original Xbox with him and introduced me to Halo:CE, Halo 2 and 
both of the Star Wars Battlefront games. I was amazed and found them fun and as I got older I wanted to know how they were made 
and even channel my creativity and time into something that could be played by myself, my family and my friends. I started 
making a 2D platformer on a program called GameMaker which we used in Year 8 at my school, it had a drag and drop feature but I 
quickly moved past that and started to learn it’s language and program the game with code instead of building blocks and that 
led into accelerating in the IT course my school offered in year 10, and I learnt new concepts quickly and scored well in all 
of the assessments. In year 12 the course split into two different subjects, Informatics and Software Development. The teacher 
in charge of courses brought me in one day and asked which one I wanted to take and to choose one, but I asked if I could take 
both and I did. I learnt so much in those two subjects and knew that that was what I wanted to do. I wanted a career in IT. 
There was a person that really is the major reason that I chose to do IT as my career instead of just a hobby on the side. My 
teacher in year 8, year 11 and the informatics teacher in year 12, Mr Croft. He nominated me for the Western Chances scholarship 
for excellence in IT. This scholarship gave me $850 to get all the tech software and hardware I wanted within reason and I 
received the scholarship for 3 years. With that I got hardware for my desktop and I also got Sony Vegas Pro and learnt how to 
edit videos and got into that area. He knew that when he gave out a 6-week assignment, I would be done in week 1 and helping my 
peers in week two. He started to challenge me and give me additional tasks I had to do for my work. Instead of a two-table 
database, mine had to have 5, and instead of importing one excel spreadsheet of data, I had to import 2, etc. He would mark me 
more harshly than the other students and really made me work hard to get full marks and helped me refine my skills in IT. He 
is the reason I wanted to study IT at a tertiary institution. </pre>


<h1> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h1>
<p> I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. Firstly, my brother went to RMIT and studied electrical engineering, he let me use his virtual desktop, 
showed me how a bunch of uni stuff worked and demonstrated why RMIT was a good university. Secondly, RMIT has Institute of Technology in it’s name, 
therefore taking technology courses here would be beneficial as it focuses on those sorts of things. Lastly, when I went to my brother’s graduation it 
showed me that RMIT was the one for me. They were efficient. As simple as that, thousands of students attended the graduation ceremony and it took around 
a few hours. My mother’s graduation took forever, the congratulated each student individually. Sure, that’s nice but it’s inefficient. IT to me is making 
things more efficient, improving everyday tasks and making them take less time. RMIT was accessible as it was in the city right next to Melbourne Central, 
easy to get to and from, had Canvas and excellent professors and resources. </p>


<h1> What do I expect to learn from my studies? </h1>
<p> I expect to learn key concepts and fundamentals of programming that I will be able to apply to a multitude of languages and areas of work. 
I also expect to learn a few programming languages and that is already happening in semester 1. Learning a bit of HTML, Java, Python and SQLite. 
I want to know the basics of databases, but I want to leave it there. I expect to learn how to channel this programming knowledge into a product or a 
project. As I’m choosing a majority of programming subjects I expect to learn a lot about programming and be able to learn what I need to get a job in 
programming. </p>
