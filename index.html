Jack Archer </p>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> <b>Summary:</b> 
I’m Aussie and I’ve never been overseas. I studied at Taylor’s Lakes Secondary College and graduated with an ATAR of 73.something. 
I studied math, English, two IT subjects and I was present in physics most of the time. I speak fluent English and I learnt a bit of Japanese 
in school but I didn’t like getting graded on it so I dropped it. I have two pet dogs and I had a pet cat but unfortunately he passed away recently. 
My brother has a snake and two cats. I’m going to be an uncle in a couple of weeks. I’ve liked video games ever since played Halo:CE on the original 
Xbox. I’ve also been learning programming to code and create games in my spare time alongside learning about computer hardware and seeing how it 
evolves and continues to improve with each cycle. I play tennis competitively, well not right now, but before the pandemic I played in Juniors at 
A Reserve 5, which was near the top grade. I also played in Seniors at C Reserve 2 and I played Pennant at Grade 10.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> What is my Interest in IT? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">
My interest in IT is primarily in programming and creating software and games, but I also have a bit of a side interest 
in computer hardware. I had my old build custom built and I chose the parts but I was hesitant to build it myself the first 
time around because $3000 was a lot to me in year 8, but whenever I got the chance I took apart old laptops and desktops to 
have a look inside and see the parts for myself. The older machines were all similar but now that my income is a bit more 
solid and I have more disposable income than I did at year 8 I can afford to build a modern desktop myself.  </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> My interest in IT 
started when I was 6 years old and my brother let me play the original Xbox with him and introduced me to Halo:CE, Halo 2 and 
both of the Star Wars Battlefront games. I was amazed and found them fun and as I got older I wanted to know how they were made 
and even channel my creativity and time into something that could be played by myself, my family and my friends.  </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;">I started 
making a 2D platformer on a program called GameMaker which we used in Year 8 at my school, it had a drag and drop feature but I 
quickly moved past that and started to learn it’s language and program the game with code instead of building blocks and that 
led into accelerating in the IT course my school offered in year 10, and I learnt new concepts quickly and scored well in all 
of the assessments. In year 12 the course split into two different subjects, Informatics and Software Development. The teacher 
in charge of courses brought me in one day and asked which one I wanted to take and to choose one, but I asked if I could take 
both and I did. I learnt so much in those two subjects and knew that that was what I wanted to do. I wanted a career in IT. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> There was a person that really is the major reason that I chose to do IT as my career instead of just a hobby on the side. My 
teacher in year 8, year 11 and the informatics teacher in year 12, Mr Croft. He nominated me for the Western Chances scholarship 
for excellence in IT. This scholarship gave me $850 to get all the tech software and hardware I wanted within reason and I 
received the scholarship for 3 years. With that I got hardware for my desktop and I also got Sony Vegas Pro and learnt how to 
edit videos and got into that area. He knew that when he gave out a 6-week assignment, I would be done in week 1 and helping my 
peers in week two. He started to challenge me and give me additional tasks I had to do for my work. Instead of a two-table 
database, mine had to have 5, and instead of importing one excel spreadsheet of data, I had to import 2, etc. He would mark me 
more harshly than the other students and really made me work hard to get full marks and helped me refine my skills in IT. He 
is the reason I wanted to study IT at a tertiary institution. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. Firstly, my brother went to RMIT and studied electrical engineering, he let me use his virtual desktop, 
showed me how a bunch of uni stuff worked and demonstrated why RMIT was a good university.  </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Secondly, RMIT has Institute of Technology in it’s name, therefore taking technology courses here would be beneficial as it focuses on 
those sorts of things. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Lastly, when I went to my brother’s graduation it 
showed me that RMIT was the one for me. They were efficient. As simple as that, thousands of students attended the graduation ceremony and it took around 
a few hours. My mother’s graduation took forever, the congratulated each student individually. Sure, that’s nice but it’s inefficient. IT to me is making 
things more efficient, improving everyday tasks and making them take less time. RMIT was accessible as it was in the city right next to Melbourne Central, 
easy to get to and from, had Canvas and excellent professors and resources. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> What do I expect to learn from my studies? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
I expect to learn key concepts and fundamentals of programming that I will be able to apply to a multitude of languages and areas of work. 
I also expect to learn a few programming languages and that is already happening in semester 1. Learning a bit of HTML, Java, Python and SQLite. 
I want to know the basics of databases, but I want to leave it there. I expect to learn how to channel this programming knowledge into a product or a 
project. As I’m choosing a majority of programming subjects I expect to learn a lot about programming and be able to learn what I need to get a job in 
that area. Independently outside of class, I will be learning C++, C# and how to use Unity. This is because I want to get a job, hopefully straight out of uni in game programming. </p>

<a style="font-family:arial;" href="url">https://careers.sledgehammergames.com/job/SLGAUSR002351EXTERNAL/Expert-Gameplay-Engineer-Sledgehammer-Games?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=phenom-feeds</a>

    </div>
<hr>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
Working at a triple A studio working on popular games and game series such as the Call of Duty franchise as an experienced programmer. This has been a goal of mine and I hope after working in the 
field as a game programmer I could one day get to this. It does not have to be Sledgehammer but since it has a studio in Melbourne that really tops it off. I would like to travel the world and see the 
sights, but I really like Australia and I would like to stay here if possible but it’s not necessary. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
Skills and qualifications needed are experience, some experience and more experience. To get to this job and any Triple A job, I need at least 8 years of experience and have to work on at least 2 games 
released on console or pc. To get to this stage, I need to find a job working on some smaller games for console or pc. Or work on a pc game on the side in a small team or individually. They want experience 
and working in the field is the only way I’ll get noticed and gain the experience I need to work on games on a scale like that. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
The skills I currently have are a little experience in making 2d scrollers and little bit of experience in Unity, but since learning that with the GitHub education pack, I can get the Unity education pack 
I’m going to put in work and learn how to create games on Unity and I am going to teach myself C# and C++ as most game development adverts I’ve seen for either mobile or console/pc require knowledge and 
experience of that. At the moment I am learning Java, SQLite and a bit of HTML which as I’ve seen so far are excellent skills to have as nearly all of the adverts I’ve seen have a section for bonus skills 
and those are in there. I think I’m pretty creative at generating ideas and ways to complete tasks. I have little experience creating games as an individual and have no experience at all working in a team 
to create games. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
I will obtain the skills required by putting in extra work on top of tertiary studies and learn C++ and C# in my own time and learn to use these to create small games and applications by using Visual Studios 
and other software. I will also learn to use Unity and how to create games on that platform as it seems to be a vital skill for a lot of jobs in game programming and development. That will be an excellent start 
and as I learn other skills from my tertiary studies, I expect to be skilled at least in the fundamentals of Java, SQLite, HTML and more. As for the experience, if I learn all those skills listed above, I believe 
I can find a job at a small studio creating mobile or console/pc games. I hope to help create popular games that I can put on my resume. As I start to have a hand in creating more and more games, that will make it 
easier to move up the jobs chain and start to work on more noticeable games. If I can achieve that, I am sure I can work at a Triple A studio in time with hard work and dedication. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
Some of the results surprised me, I thought I was more of a visual learner, but it seems I am more of an auditory learner than I had first thought. The creativity test was surprising too, 
I thought I was creative but according to the test I am just above average. The Myers Briggs/personality test was interesting to look at as it showed me that even though I thought I was 
introverted I am clearly not and the questions asked showed me that I tend to find it easy to work with new people so that will definitely help with the next project. I knew I was not as 
observant as I was intuitive and the prospecting one was not surprising either. I am always thinking about what if, what would happen if that happened. What would happen if the monarch were 
reinstated in Australia against the people’s wishes and would be the consequences and the reactions of the public. I was often the person asked, ‘what are you thinking about?’ and I would 
come out with something so random that it would either make people laugh or look concerned. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
The results seem to be well suited for working in a team. I am creative and can find solutions to problems, as well as being extraverted and able to introduce myself to new people 
and work with them. Although I think about the what if’s and things that are far away, I can put things in perspective and work on something more realistic and closer to home. The thing is, 
results are a free test, it could be right, but it could also not. These are random questions to try and show you your personality. The only person who knows that best is me and I believe I 
can work well in a team and bring something to the table. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> 
When forming a team, I think that my skills and personality allow me to work with anyone really. The biggest constraint is the type of project that we work on. I would prefer something challenging that 
we will work on right up to the deadline, something can be continued to be improved and something that can be experienced more than used. For example, making a game with a story would be my preference and 
that would not be amenable to peers who want to make a simple website as their project. It seems they would like something easy and quick that they can rely on to be completed. I do not think I would work 
well with a team comprised of people like that. I do not want to do something extremely easy or something that is impossible. </p>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;"> Project Idea </h1>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Overview: </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> My idea is to create a 3D first-person shooting game with a story in Unity. My idea is for the protagonist to be in a post-apocalyptic world set in 2045 
after a series of nuclear strikes worldwide by the powers of the world. Entire continents have sunken into the ocean and the ones left above the water have 
severe pollution and radiation killing anything that is exposed to the lethal combination. Military of every nation was crippled following a struggle of power 
and the only way to travel by sea was to create ships out of scrap metal. They resemble pirate ships. </p>

        </div>
    </div>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Motivation: </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> My motivation is that I want to create a game independently and I want to create a game that combines my favourites. I really enjoyed Mass Effect because of its 
story and combat and I really enjoyed sailing around in the open world setting of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. I want to combine these two games into a 
creation of my own, this concept can be seen as something similar to Waterworld but I was not aware that it was a film about people living on a mostly ocean 
world, scavenging to survive. Maybe I can watch that film to get some more inspiration about what an environment like that might look like. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> I want to meet it 
in the middle of space and pirates, I do not want space pirates, I want an interesting and engaging story that has fun mechanics and a mission based open world. 
For this project I am happy to just work on one mission or area with a story told within it. My project does not have to be in this world I am describing but 
this is an interesting concept I thought of when eating a piece of toast and scribbled down and thought more on. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> I want to turn an idea into a creation. These 
two games I want to fuse together were very popular: Black Flag sold 11 million copies and the Mass Effect trilogy sold a total of 14 million copies. These are 
unrealistic to include in this project idea, but can be used as a guideline as to what is popular and what other players like. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Description </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> The world is on fire; entire continents are gone, swallowed by the depths of the ocean as the nuclear fallout of every nation comes down. A struggle for military 
dominance, naval and air superiority ensues, and military bases of all nations are taken out by others. No one comes out on top and most nations are engulfed in 
toxic pollution and radiation following the detonation of multiple nuclear devices and bombs within their cities and towns. Billions perished within the first 
few hours of the global catastrophe and more died due to exposure to the deadly radiation and pollution. Surprisingly only the Eastern side of Australia was hit 
by nuclear devices and in the Western side only the military bases were taken out by other nations. Small island nations and parts of continents survived but 
struggle to cope in the damaged environment that has mostly turned into water. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> To continue to survive, the remaining military of Australia worked together to 
create a ship out of the scrap and rubble left behind in the wreckages once called cities. They created a ship that used to sail around in the days of pirates 
and Kings, with a few technological upgrades. The protagonist leads a small team of soldiers and naval workers on a surveying voyage to explore what remains of 
other nations and continents. The idea behind this game is to explore other nations in a series of missions and uncover the truth behind the cause of this global 
catastrophe. Characters will interact with each other and the protagonist and create bonds, friendships and even relationships. Learning more about the world 
around you and learning about the people closest to you will provide meaningful insight and story into this post-apocalyptic hellscape, that is the Earth. 
Innovations of existing technologies will exist, like ATV’s with light-machine guns on the rear for the passenger to use to explore hostile and dangerous lands, 
jet skis with automatic rifles strapped to either side for exploration in rivers and inland bodies of water. Cool additions to existing technology and bringing 
pirating and exploring the extended 7 seas into the modern era. As previously mapped out maps of the world will only be vague guided to the new devastated world. 
Economies crumbled, and currencies became worthless as governments of surviving nations tried to stabilise their lands. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Obviously that scale is unrealistic for a
project, but something that is possible is to create a section or one mission. Either being a sailing section of the pirate ship, maybe even being able to sail and
 release the wheel allowing you to talk to crew members to build a story and environment. Also, could do a fighting section were you have to fight off sick and diseased 
 dwellers at the edge of an irradiated city or to fight some mercenaries trying to scavenge and loot a town with innocents in it. The possibilities are endless in this 
 world I have thought up. I just want to give it justice and get into story telling and even some environmental story telling where maybe a struggle took place and while 
 fighting off mercenaries you can follow the signs of resistance and rescue an innocent woman being dragged away by the mercenaries. I have left the description a bit vague 
 as if I went into the main character or backstories of cities and crew members this would turn into a 17 page essay. </p>
 
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Tools and Technologies </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> The software needed for this project is simply Unity, the best part is that when applying for the student package on Github I noticed that when looking for similar options 
for that on the Unity website, it can use your approved Github education pack and instantly apply to Unity. A laptop will do for the hardware as the game will not be very 
big or very graphically detailed, as we would use free assets on the Unity asset store. No other equipment would be needed other than microphones to easily communicate and 
possibly record some voice lines for characters in the game. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Skills Required </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Skills required for this project would be a basic knowledge of Unity. Even as I am studying these introductory courses, I am applying myself and trying to learn how to use 
Unity and code in C++ and C#. Creating games is not for everyone and group members not skilled in using Unity would be able to draw concept art and other useful graphical 
items that needed to be done. Could also record voice lines, clips, sounds and anything else that could be useful for audio in the game. They could watch a couple tutorial 
videos to try to understand it. A project does not always need every member to code, depending on the specifications, we might need to create a user guide, we might need 
someone to play test the game that does not know all of the functions. Maybe someone to organise who works on what, in a sort of team leader position. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> I would also be amenable 
to working on something else, I would like to do a voting system on everyone’s project idea, I feel that would be democratically the best and would allow members to work together 
collaboratively if everyone is on the same page. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Outcome </h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> If the project is a success, the outcome will be a small section of an idea turned into a playable demo for a game. Whether it be sailing a pirate ship, talking to crew members 
and learning about these people and the environment around you, or even just a shoot em’ up section where the story telling is not through dialogue and maybe is through the rooms 
or environment you go through. The outcome I hope for is to create a fun and interesting story with playable and fun mechanics to explore the idea of a nuclear devastated world with 
mostly water and a lack of technology. The impact this development will have is not some grand thing like world peace, but hopefully it will make some players happy and take their 
mind off of the pandemic and widespread panic around us, and let them relax and enjoy an interesting concept for a game. </p>
