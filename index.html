<p>I’m Aussie and I’ve never been overseas. I studied at Taylor’s Lakes Secondary College and graduated with an ATAR of 73.something. 
I studied math, English, two IT subjects and I was present in physics most of the time. I speak fluent English and I learnt a bit of Japanese 
in school but I didn’t like getting graded on it so I dropped it. I have two pet dogs and I had a pet cat but unfortunately he passed away recently. 
My brother has a snake and two cats. I’m going to be an uncle in a couple of weeks. I’ve liked video games ever since played Halo:CE on the original 
Xbox. I’ve also been learning programming to code and create games in my spare time alongside learning about computer hardware and seeing how it 
evolves and continues to improve with each cycle. I play tennis competitively, well not right now, but before the pandemic I played in Juniors at 
A Reserve 5, which was near the top grade. I also played in Seniors at C Reserve 2 and I played Pennant at Grade 10.</p>
